# Predicting the response rate of a marketing campaign, using a dataset from ABC insurance company
## Project context
    The ABC insurance company is planning a new marketing campaign for their insurance policy product. It is costly for the company
to advertise to customers that seem likely to renew (response = Yes), so the company wants to create a tool to predict how customers of 
various customer segments will response to the campaign. The insurance company provided a historical dataset of their existing customers,
and the goal of the model is to predict which customers will respond (respond = Yes) and minimize false positive margin.
